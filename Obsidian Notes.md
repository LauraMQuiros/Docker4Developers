## 1. Why Docker?
Allows seamless upgrades
	Without containers, an admin has to update every server and dependencies. With containers, you tell the _orchestrator_ you want to run a new *image version* and it gradually replaces every container with another one running the new version
	
```python
RUN 
```

Standardization for Containers
	When a machine runs the container image in which you have put your software, the container is created and the image is put inside. 

## Learning Centre Docker Desktop
The container display in Docker Desktop has 4 elements in the table: name, image, status and port(s)
By clicking in name you can access the log of the running of the container, as well as stopping it
By clicking in the port, you obtain the localhost link which will open in your browser
